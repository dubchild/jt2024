### In January of 2024, I got a call from a close friend who was interested in commissioning a custom media center. B wanted to know if I could design a custom piece to fit in a small alcove in his girlfriend's house. I tried to document the whole process here in the same way I would present a case study for a website. 

Over the next few months we met to discuss size requirements and finishing options. Open source furniture designs gave me a lot of ideas to explore and I settled on three different designs. They liked all of the designs equally, and took their time making a decision. We eventually decided on a combination of features from all the designs. Needless to say, I got a lot of 3D-modeling experience on this project.

### **Problem**
B's girlfriend, D, bought a house and she wants a custom media center to fit into an alcove in the living room. The house has 14 foot ceilings and the previous owner had mounted a flatscreen TV high on the back wall of the alcove. D finds it way too high for her to view comfortably and desired something that fit the space better than the cabinet they were using now. 

### Project Discovery
I went to the house to take measurements and pitch my ideas. I thought they wanted a built-in so I proposed running rails along the side walls, but that was dismissed immediately. They were adamant that the piece should be free-standing, so it could be moved in the future.

I measured the alcove with a laser and took photos for reference. I also took note of the thick baseboard trim to make sure the legs of the cabinet would fit in the available floor space. I examined the cabinet they were replacing and loved the hidden drawer it had under the top rail. They asked if it was possible to include a similar feature in my piece. Yes, please! I've always wanted to make something with hidden drawers. Hell, why not 2 hidden drawers?

#### Concerns
The drawer needs to be invisible from normal viewing distance. I suggested built-in power and cable management but they didn't care about those at all. I also suggested the bottom could be made so the cats couldn't get under it but they also declined, stating that the cats like to hang out under the media center and they didn't want to deprive them of that joy. :)

#### Constraints
- Fit inside 5'2' alcove
- Fit in my Jeep for delivery
- Width: 60" (or less)
- Height: Over 32"
- Length: Less than 20"
- 4 shelves, tall enough to display DVD cases

#### Bonus Features
- 2 Hidden drawer(s)
- Space for kitties underneath

### Solution

I made 3 fully parametric 3D models in Fusion and applied 3D wood materials to make high-quality renders of each design. When you design parametrically, you can establish relationships that let you resize the model to make small adjustments or generate plans with different dimensions. For instance I could create a matching set of end tables or just shorter, wider or skinnier versions of original cabinet by changing a couple values. 

I played with different wood textures, trying contrasting accents for fun, but decided to stick to a single species after discussion with the clients. At some point, I changed the drawer bottoms to a brick-red tinted wood texture on the inside. I really liked the contrast to the exterior whitewash stain in the renders, so I kept it in as a surprise for the first time they open the drawers. Hidden drawers with red bottoms. I thought it could become a trademark of my furniture. Like Louboutins, but with furniture. 

#### Research 
I had never built a media cabinet or anything this big by myself, so I did a lot of online research on construction and joinery techniques for building cabinets. I waffled back and forth between using dowels to join everything vs pocket screws. I have experience with both but I wanted to grow my skillset. 

During my research, I re-discovered the technique of using floating tenon joinery that gives you the main benefits of using dominoes, dowels and biscuits, but way cheaper. By using the "loose tenon" technique, I added some slop to help make alignment more forgiving during assembly.

I went down a rabbit-hole learning how to design furniture using mortise and tenons, consuming many blogs and videos. I bought some tools and accessories that I would need and started practicing. Some of those tools worked well, others proved to be more trouble than they are worth, so I learned to make my own. For practice, I built a small laptop stand that my wife had been wanting for a long time. Now I had the skills and confidence to create my own router templates for cutting all the mortises for the loose tenons.

------------

### Prototyping
This project had a lot of features and required techniques I had never used before. My other large furniture pieces relied on an cheap doweling jig that required a lot of fiddling and failure before achieving decent results. I was determined to learn a more reliable techniques. 

I exported detailed shop drawings in various views and compiled a cutlist for all the panels and pieces. The drawings were included in PDFs with detailed descriptions, estimated timeline, labor and material costs. After the clients gave final approval, they made a down payment to cover materials and design.

#### Router Templates
It took me a couple of false starts but I made several laser-cut templates for producing repeatable slots exactly where I needed them for 6 different joints configurations that I would need. Ordinarily dominoes require a very expensive proprietary machine that I can't justify owning yet. However, I was able to design some jigs for my plunge router that worked great. 

Using a 16mm router bushing as a guide, I calculated the paths I would need to make laser-cut jigs that made perfect slots every time. Using digital calipers to get accurate measurements of ACTUAL thickness of my material, I designed jigs with finger joints and slots. I used swappable parts on the surface of each jig that allowed me to cut either tight slots, or loose slots depending on my needs. The experience gave me the confidence to make more jigs for creating even more complicated joinery.

#### Raw Material Selection
I used Cutlist Pro to generate optimal cuts for all the panels and boards. The app calculates the number of pieces I can cut out of each board or panel. It makes a cutlist of all of your cuts, taking into account the length and width of pieces, the saw blade width, grain direction and other concerns. 
 
Having a visual representation of how much material is needed, and how much would be left over, minimizes waste and helps plan ahead for fixing inevitable errors. It also showed that I should have enough material left over to make a prototype of my next project, a fancy laptop stand.  I bought stain, boards and plywood from a local lumber yard, everything else I had to get online.

- 3/4" hard maple boards (42bf)  
- 3/4"x4'x8' sheets of cabinet grade Maple plywood (2)
- 5x18x30mm dominoes (100)
- maple edge banding (25')
- maple pocket hole plugs (50)
- 14" side-mount keyboard drawer slides (4)
- Gray/White translucent stain
- Red translucent stain
- Matte Polycrylic clearcoat
- Leveling floor pads

#### Drawer Hardware
It actually took me a long time to find the drawer slides I wanted to use. I'm no expert on drawer hardware so I had to learn the marketing lingo. I wanted them to be invisible, quiet, light, sturdy, and easy to mount to a finished cabinet. The magic words turned out to be "Underdesk Keyboard Drawer Slides." Keyboard drawer is exactly the type of hardware action I was looking for. The drawers are only 2 inches tall and are intended to hold random charging cords, batteries, remotes etc so the 25 pound weight limit is more than enough.

#### Stain & Finish
D. wanted a weathered or white-washed stain similar to her current media cabinet. I suggested that maple would be the best material for the job. It's hard and has a light creamy grain that is easy to whitewash. I tried several stains and offered samples for review before deciding on a stain color.

### Parametric Design
I have been using Fusion, a favored tool by woodworkers and makers around the world, for about 4 years. I used it in the beginning stages of this project but for many reasons I ended up reproducing the final design using a newer app called Shapr3d. It's not perfect, but it's an amazing piece of software that give me access to most of the tools I need in a much simpler package without all the manufacturing, tooling and analysis tools I don't need. A huge benefit is the ability to send cloud links to clients so they can visualize and interact with the design in 3D. With a smart phone, you can even view the 3D model overlayed in your environment with AR.

#### Goals & Ulterior Motives
The specific purpose of this project is to make a physical piece of furniture out of wood for my friend. However, there is a secondary goal that takes extra time and planning but is worth the effort to learn. I plan my projects to make sure that by adjusting various dimensions I can make alternate versions of the same design. I could make plans for different form factors like a low-rise coffee table, a sideboard, buffet, credenza, or matching end tables - all from the same base design and sharing the same features.

I planned the project in order to explore some techniques and new tools. I finally had a reason to use my dowel-cutter bits that had been collecting dust since Christmas. I could now hide the pocket holes by cutting plugs out of the scrap maple boards. With some effort I was able to grain-match and get nearly invisible plugs. You can't see them unless you are looking for them.

#### Loose Slots!
I originally went overboard planning the assembly with floating tenons. Being a complete noob, I had the silly idea that I could use them for EVERYTHING. All in. 

Essentially, you cut a mortise slot on every joint face, making one side a few millimeters longer. Then you glue dominoes between both mortises, hence "floating" or "loose" tenons. Similar methods require exacting precision that I'm just not capable of yet. Loose tenons prevent you from having to buy more lumber if you mess up one alignment out of dozens. 

However, the reality is that the sheer number of mortise slots I would have to cut was unsustainable and I got myself confused several times. Two of the boards for the legs were rotated the wrong way and I cut an extra slot on each of them. They needed to be filled or hidden at some point. I spent weeks trying to decide how to fix it. I decided that pocket holes had value to the project...and my sanity.

#### Pocket Holes
During assembly of the side panels I made the realization that I had missed my opportunity to attach plywood to the side panels with dominoes the way I designed it. I also realized that in practice, that it was a bad plan anyway. Pocket holes to the rescue! 

I had only used my Kreg jig a few times and was not an expert. Luckily I am used to messing up so I took a break and practiced setting the proper depth drilling holes. I'm happy to report that it worked great and saved me a lot of time and anxiety. The only problem is that I needed to buy some pocket hole plugs and make a couple of dowel plugs to hide the pockets.

#### Assembly 
It took me way too long to assemble the cabinet. I ran into some issues with my design and had to make changes on the fly like reducing the number of dominoes and cutting rails to support the horizontal shelf panels. 

I made the six legs out of lumber and then cut the plywood panels to fit. After I glued them up, I dry-fit them with the front and back rails. Again, because of my inexperience, I spent way too much time contemplating how to proceed at each step. I saved myself some headaches, but still made some dumb mistakes. Often, the pieces stayed stacked up or dry-fit for a week while I worked on other things and waited for hardware. 

In the end, it took me 2 weeks to work out the hidden drawer design and production. The drawer slides I had bought didn't work the way I thought they did and I was forced to adjust my plan yet again. I originally planned to use dominoes but I didn't want to cut more slots at this point. By now my friend was asking when it would be done and I just needed to get finished.

I made a separate 3D model to work out the drawer assembly and mounting. The mounting brackets required very specific placement of the rails to ensure that the drawers were invisible from the outside. I mocked it up with scraps and made some more adjustments. 

From past experience, I disliked staining fully assembled furniture so I decided to stain and finish each panel, rail and shelf before final assembly. Getting stain applied and wiped without streaking or spotting is so nervewracking. This worked well and

**Final Thoughts**

This project represents many personal milestones for me and I had a blast working on it. I've never had a project that involved as many skills or as much personal growth as this. The product line continues to evolve as it moves to the next stage. I'm currently producing a bespoke website to market them outside of Etsy. I have a debt of gratitude to YC for being the catalyst for all of this.  This experience was full of highs and lows. The countless bouts of anxiety that I had during the weeks that it took me to finish the assembly cannot be understated. I'm not proud of my pace, but I'm ultimately proud of the final product.
