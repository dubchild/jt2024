### This is a spec proposal for an app I came up with for a job that turned out to be an elaborate scam. Someone posing as an HR rep at FashionNova contacted me. The job was real, but the person I was contacted by was a scammer.

After passing multiple rounds of interviews, including this spec project, they tried to rope me into some identity theft and fraud scheme. I apologize that it's not complete, but it was never a real thing and I put too much work into it not to show somewhere.

Design & Research: 2 Days

Prototyping: 2 Days

Production: N/A

_____________
### **Problem**
The spec guidelines told me to make up a proposal for a product. That was it. I asked for more detail and was told that everything was up to me. It was intended to be vague in order to gauge potential hires skillset. They essentially said "show off what you can do." Okay. Bet...

***AI was recently gaining more attention so I immediately thought of something to generate ideas for an AI-enabled fast fashion app.***

### Project Discovery

Since the assignment was so vague and intended to be a contrived exercise, I decided to run wild with the AI idea. I only had a couple days to complete the project so I made a list of assets and documents I wanted to generate including: 

- Custom App Logo
- Loading screen animation
- Personas & User Journies
- App Flowchart
- Show 2 roles: Shopper and Creator

#### Concerns
I wanted to make a good impression and admittedly, cash in on the AI hype. Why not? I had been wanting to explore motion graphics and interactive micro-animations so I excitedly planned too many ideas. After paring them down to a list I thought was achievable in the short time period I had, I had to decide whether to continue using Figma. At the time, Adobe was trying to buy Figma, and I wanted to start exploring some of the competitors like Lunacy, Linearity Curve, and Penpot. 

- are standard animation curves built-in?
- are there pre-made UI kits?
- do I have enough time to learn a new component system?

The animation and UI kit features were a mixed bag in the new apps. Probably serviceable for lo-fi mockups. However, I was not able to build enough confidence to try a new tool for this project in the short time I had. Figma won this time.

### Solution

My idea was essentially an app that would offer the ability to generate AI-assisted designs from user prompts, and apply them to existing clothing items in the catalog. Imagine something like CafePress but with the latest stylish, fitted clothing instead of one-size-fits-all t-shirts and hoodies in limited colors and sizes.

As a bonus, users could opt to be "Creators" and collect a fee for each sale of their design. There could be a program for "Featured" artists from the community, and collabs with celebrity designers.

At the end of my crash course in each of the contender apps, I chose to stick with Figma after deciding they were missing too many features I considered essential. 
  
#### Research 
I checked FashionNova's "fast fashion" competitors to see if anyone was doing something similar. I checked Shein, H&M and more and couldn't find anything at the time. Things may have changed. In fact, I think the idea has legs and someone will do it. However, I have no research data or expectation this business would be viable, but it seems inevitable. 

I wanted the app to skip the clunky onboarding process common to so many services. All users will be presented with a 5-second loading animation that introduces the app's purpose visually. It fades to a single, friendly input prompt on the home page and a randomized list of recent popular designs to click on for inspiration. 

Ideally the prompt that was used to generate the design can also be viewed and copied or iterated upon with AI-suggested options. An alternate dashboard would track a creator's designs and allow them to earn credits and/or cash out their share of the sales generated by their designs. 

#### Design Constraints
- Catchy app pitch
- Splash screen animation
- Seamless transition to app UI
- Detailed App flow
- Simple prompt UI (like google search)
- Minimum of 5 detailed screen/features
- 3 personas
- 2 user journeys
- UI Kit (icons, buttons, forms)
- Figma prototyping
- Video walk-through of the interactive mockup with voiceover

### Prototyping
I didn't have much time to prototype, so after some quick and dirty pencil and paper sketches I started building a lo-fi version of the home page right away. I added thumb navigation links at the bottom and took my time selecting the icons I would need.

- paper sketches of the mobile app UI
- lo-fi Figma sketches
- medium-fi Figma sketches
- loading screen animation

#### Goals
The specific end goal is to have a **single parametric design** that can be edited to generate cut files at any scale. The parts **must be repeatable** and be able to adjust designs for materials of varying thicknesses.

**Final Thoughts**

 This project represents many personal milestones for me and I had a blast working on it. I've never had a project that involved as many skills or as much personal growth as this. The product line continues to evolve as it moves to the next stage. I'm currently producing a bespoke website to market them outside of Etsy. I have a debt of gratitude to YC for being the catalyst for all of this.
