### A stranger emailed me about making a cat wall based on Mario blocks. I accepted the challenge and designed a line of products for my Etsy store based on her commission. Since Black Friday, I have sold almost 30 blocks to more than a dozen satisfied customers. This is how I did it...

_____________
### **Summary**
In the summer of 2023 I ***recieved a message from a stranger (YC) on Etsy*** that liked my products. She wanted to know if I could design a cat wall for her based on Super Mario blocks. She indicated that she wanted a whole set now, with the possibility to add more pieces later. My answer was an emphatic **'YES!'** 
_____________
### **Problem**
***YC had a wall in her home that she wanted covered in Mario blocks*** so her cats can jump around like they're in the game. Before I even started designing the blocks, I estimated that a 6 piece set based on my first sketch would ***cost up to $400, but that she didn't have to buy all of them at once.*** She was also completely unfazed by my estimation that it would also ***take several months*** to complete the project. I couldn't ask for a more accommodating and patient client. She was kept in the loop during the 3 months it took to go from sketch -> 3D model -> prototypes -> final product.

***YC's choice to illustrate the concept with fridge magnets was adorable.***

### Project Discovery

I combined all of YC's ideas with my mine to refine the concept even more. Over the next few weeks I explained my approach in detail including construction, material and hardware. She was receptive to everything I pitched and trusted my expertise, which I appreciated immensely.

#### Concerns
Before I moved beyond sketches I had to make sure that YC understood what she was getting into. We had discussions about the following issues:

- be aware each shelf will require 4 holes in the wall
- requires permission if you have a landlord
- requires tools for installation
- how much do your cats weigh?
- turn-around time of 2 months

She wasn't bothered by any of my concerns and was excited for me to get going. Her cats are much smaller than mine, plus she had access to tools and permission. Well that was good enough for me! I was excited to get into design mode, but immediately I had an epiphany about the reality of this project.

#### Art v. Product
The evolving scope made it clear that this project would have to be treated like a full product. Realistically, there was no way I was going to put this much effort into a one-off art-piece! I've done that before and I learned that ***art and product are two completely different things.*** 

**Essentially, this thing needed to be printable to be worth my effort.** Having the ability to print duplicates at will, ensures faster turn-around and minimizes cost. Simply put, the games have dozens of block types and associated elements meaning the possibilities and combinations enabled by this modular system were limitless. 

**The guiding design principle was that the blocks had to be reproducible, scalable, and easy to modify.**

----------- 
### Solution

This was beginnning to be a much larger project than anticipated, so I decided to make it more manageable by breaking it into 4 broad phases, guided by a list of constraints.
  
- Research 
- 3D Parametric Modeling
- Prototyping
- Production

#### Research 
I found a collection of vector files that had just about every block that has ever been featured in Super Mario games. Once you see them all together, you notice right away that the block designs have changed significantly over time, depending on the game and art style.

Before going any further, I had to choose which look to emulate. After consulting the client, we agreed that the 3-row brick was the more 'iconic' look. It also introduced some unforeseen challenges. 

For instance, in the 2D games, players are only shown the front face of the blocks. However, the brick pattern doesn't make sense if you try to paste the front face around a cube. I looked at screenshots and videos of the 3D games and was able to discern the correct pattern. Related issues are documented throughout this document. 

#### Design Constraints
- easy to mount hardware brackets 
- a sturdy frame (slides over brackets)
- a rigid cube with 5 sides (slides over frame)
- light-weight (less than 2 lbs.)
- easily support 20lb cat jumping
- made from locally available materials
- production cost kept under $10/unit
- "printable" at will
- rearrangable, modular, & modifiable
- compatible with other Mario products (wall decals, plushies etc)
- design files and instructions packed for sale on digital platforms

_Originally I was going to use a chunk of 2x8x8 pine wood that would require hand-drilling 2 parallel 1/2" holes through the block to recieve the bracket posts. This turned out to be much harder than I thought it would be and after several attempts I decided that I could just design a ribbed frame to be laser-cut out of plywood._

------------

### Prototyping
Over the next 2 months I worked on scale model prototypes and material/finish tests in order to perfect the design and work out production details such as:

- optimal dimensions
- best stain/paint/finish combo
- solid wood frame vs. laser cut plywood frame
- finger-joint alignment
- flat-pack vs. full assembly

Before I wasted large amounts of pre-finished panels, I worked at 100mm scale and created several prototype faces that I used to test wood finishes and techniques for darkening up the "mortar" lines between the bricks. I used the ingenius Boxes.py website to generate a small finger-joint box that I could work with. After applying the brick/mortar pattern to the faces, I quickly realized some aesthetic issues with my design. I had to have more control over the spacing and size of the finger-joints than boxes.py allowed.

#### Raw Material Selection
Many of the constraints were met by my choice in material. Plywood comes in many types but is mainly divided into **veneer-core** which uses low-quality wood with voids and other defects for the middle, and **MDF-core** which uses a uniform layer of composite material in the middle which cuts evenly and predictably on a laser. I chose locally sourced MDF-core plywood, roughly 1/4" (5.2mm) thick, for it's price, availability, and strength. My local lumber yard is less than a mile from my house and has a suitable Maple plywood for about $40 per sheet. No brainer. 

BONUS: I already had a piece left over from a previous shelf project which allowed me to get into prototyping right away!

#### Size & Shape
Shape and dimensions were dictated by the size and weight of the average cat, as well as the nature of the object. At the fundamental level, it's a cube: meaning it has 6 identical sides. I measured the various cat trees in my house, consulted Amazon listings, and local stores to find the average cat platform is about 8" deep. Based on this information, I decided the optimal size for the Mario blocks would be 8" cubes._(I chose to round down to 200mm to make 3d-modeling easier.)_

#### Hardware
The smallest floating shelf brackets I found on Amazon are around 5-6" long and require a minimum of 2 per shelf. Small brackets under 8" wide with 2 posts do not exist as far as I can tell. It probably has something to do with standard wall studs being 16" apart. I found bulk packages of brackets that would make all the hardware (brackets, anchors and screws) cost less than $2.50 per shelf.

#### Safety
I wanted small brackets to keep the frame as small as possible, while ensuring strength and safety. I chose brackets with the smallest screw plate so I could keep the size and cost of the rigid inner frame down. Each shelf should easily hold 75lbs when installed properly. Over-engineered for sure, but peace of mind is priceless and I want people to be confident that the product is safe. ***I also don't want people mad at ME when their chonkers rip a hole in the drywall. :)*** 

#### Colors
I researched the hex values used for the graphical assets in the Super Mario video games. I also gathered reference images and watched videos of gameplay so I could match the colors of the blocks as accurately as possible. 

#### Stain & Finish
I needed to do hands-on research to get the colors right. First, I took scraps of THE SAME PLYWOOD I would be using, and made sample swatches of various shades of cherry, mahogany, teak, and red oak stains. None of them were satisfactory. I tried watering down various red paints, watercolors, colored chalk, and alcohol inks. None of them provided satisfactory results.

My search led me to a line of translucent stains that comes in a rainbow of 200 colors. The product is a bit tricky to use but really highlights the natural wood grain and is totally worth it. I polled my braintrust, and we decided on a burnt orange/red color called **Spice** for the bricks, and **Daffodil** for the yellow question block. Water-based stains dry faster, produce less fumes and are much better for the environment than other options. The translucent stain also **adds natural variation to the bricks**, making each block unique. Sold.

[_During the production of the prototype blocks, a new game called "Super Mario Wonder" was released that featured the classic question block dressed up in PINK. I consulted the color list and made another trip to the hardware store to pick up **Pink!** stain to make it happen too!_]

#### Masking & Painting
Lasers leave sticky residue on the top surface of materials, and can cause unsightly burns on the bottom surface. To prevent this, I apply a thin layer of paper masking tape to all surfaces. It doubles as a handy 'mask' of your surface material when doing cutting and engraving operations. 

In the case of the brick pattern, I stain the panels first, apply masking to both sides, then cut and label the parts with the finished side down. I flip the panels over to engrave the 'mortar', creating the brick pattern. After engraving, I lay down 2 coats of matte black spray paint to color in the 'mortar', and a final coat of clear-coat to seal it. The masking also protects the finished brick faces until it is removed before shipping.

----------

### Parametric Design
For the last 4 years I have been obsessed with the power of parametric design and this project really allowed me to improve my skills. Many packages offer a form of parametrics, but **Autodesk Fusion 360** is a favorite CAD package among woodworkers. Using variables and mathematic formulas to build **parametric relationships** rather than relying solely on static dimensions, you can generate cut files from complex 3D designs at any physical dimension and aspect ratio. 

#### Goals
The specific end goal is to have a **single parametric design** that can be edited to generate cut files at any scale. The parts **must be repeatable** and be able to adjust designs for materials of varying thicknesses. You see, the thickness of the material controls the inner dimensions of perpendicular fingers and holes and those dimensions will change when you adjust the material thickness.

#### Finger-joints
Finger-joints are the go-to method of building laser-cut boxes. Ideally, they should **snap-fit** together with minimal effort. There are many tools and plugins that can be used but none of them gave me enough control over the spacing and alignment. When done correctly, you don't even HAVE to use glue, but I do anyway. 

I learned how to **generate them parametrically.**  I devised formulas that scale perfectly and generate parts that snap together with a tight fit no matter what the outer dimensions are. What this means is: **My design scales to any size I want, while maintaining all position and sizing relationships.** :) 

#### Brick Pattern
Most examples I found on the web **lazily repeat the front face** but if you look at the 3D games closely there is a **second pattern** that is revealed on 2 opposing sides. I developed a second algorithm to generate the desired pattern and spacing for the alternate bricks. The math is a lot more difficult than it appears at first glance. It gave me some headaches, but it forced me to  **learn how to think parametrically** and work smarter in Fusion 360. 

The front/top/bottom/back panels could all be the same face, whereas the sides needed to be a complementary pattern that would make sense if the individual bricks were real 3D objects. Early in the process it was obvious that the brick pattern had to be balanced with the finger-joint placement, otherwise the design looked messy. The question block could be made just by removing the brick pattern and substituting the question mark and rivets. At this point

#### Scaling 
Once I was satisfied with my 3D model, I doubled the x, y, z dimensions from 100mm to the final dimension of 200mm. I was thrilled beyond belief that I had **achieved a file that scaled perfectly!** I celebrated by printing a full-size box out of 5mm cardboard and proceeded to do a little dance. :) 

#### Kerf-Correction
After achieving **Parametric Nirvana**, the next step was generating cut sheets that automatically account for the width of MY specific laser beam and the space it leaves after cutting. Because of the way lasers work, if you want tight fits, you have to offset the fingers and hole outlines by half of the kerf-width. There are several ways to do this but the tedious nature of it led me to find a **plugin** that does both operations at once. Hundredths of an inch or millimeter can make or break a **snap-fit finger-joint** project. Figuring out this step helped relieve some anxiety and sped up production by a factor of 3! Shout out to **Mapboards Pro!**

### Production:
During the prototype phase I determined that each face would take about 4 minutes to cut. Engraving the brick faces would take about an hour each. I tried everything I could think of to reduce this time but the engrave quality went down as I increased the speed. I needed the bricks to feature a raised surface, and a contrasting matte texture representing the mortar between the bricks. I experimented with defocusing the laser to shape the beam wider, which gave a steeply angled 3D-edge that enhanced the overall aesthetic by catching highlights.

#### Design Changes 
As we know, a full cube has 6 sides, but with the back side  of these shelves facing the wall, ***I was convinced that I didn't need a back face.*** I could further reduce production time by using an unfinished plywood face for the top that didn't need engraved. At this point I changed the design to add 1/4" stablized cork on top to give cats a softer landing. The cork also provides a nice surface for engraving my logo and anything else the customer wants. Eliminating 2 finished faces from the product reduced production time and overall cost. Instead of 6 faces, now I only had to deal with 4 engraved plywood faces.

#### Re-sawing Plywood
Plywood is much cheaper if you buy full sheets and re-saw it yourself. The alternative is buying pre-cut panels that can run up to $20 per 12"x20" sheet. One block would take at least 4 sheets of material and cost over $80 in raw materials, leaving lots of waste and no room for profit. _Booooooooo!_

So I used an app on my phone to work out dimensions and options for re-sawing a 4'x8' sheet of plywood into smaller panels. The app calculates the number of panels I can cut from one sheet of plywood, taking into account the length and width of pieces, the saw blade width, grain direction and other concerns. My laser's bed is only big enough to cut 2 faces at once, so 16"x8" was a good place to start. 

I added a half inch of padding in each direction to arrive at a panel size of **16.5"L x 8.5"W.** I put all my settings into the app to generate an image showing my cuts laid out on sheet of plywood. It indicates all panels (sorted by size) as well as the leftover material and a table of stats. It really helps you visualize and keep a record of your cuts by doing all the repetetive math automatically while you make adjustments. There are other ways to do this, but having an app on your phone while you are out in the shop or shopping for material is indispensible.

**Final Thoughts**

 This project represents many personal milestones for me and I had a blast working on it. I've never had a project that involved as many skills or as much personal growth as this. The product line continues to evolve as it moves to the next stage. I'm currently producing a bespoke website to market them outside of Etsy. I have a debt of gratitude to YC for being the catalyst for all of this.
