### In the summer of 2023 I recieved a message from a stranger (YC) on Etsy that liked my products. YC wanted to know if I could design a cat wall for her based on Super Mario blocks. She wanted to commission a whole set, with the possibility to add more pieces later. My answer was an emphatic **'YES!'** 

I accepted the challenge and designed a line of products for my Etsy store. I have sold over 30 blocks to more than a dozen satisfied customers. This is how I did it...

***YC's choice to illustrate the concept with fridge magnets was adorable.***

### Project Discovery

I combined all of YC's ideas with my mine to refine the concept even more. Over the next few weeks I explained my approach in detail including construction, material and hardware. She was receptive to everything I pitched and trusted my expertise, which I appreciated immensely.

#### Concerns

- be aware each shelf will require 4 holes in the wall
- requires permission if you have a landlord
- requires tools for installation
- how much do your cats weigh?
- turn-around time of 2 months

### Parametric Design
For the last 4 years I have been obsessed with the power of parametric design and this project really allowed me to improve my skills. Many packages offer a form of parametric control, but **Autodesk Fusion 360** is a favorite CAD package among woodworkers. Using variables and mathematic formulas to build **parametric relationships** rather than relying solely on static dimensions, I'm able to generate cut files from complex 3D designs, at any scale. I switched to Shaper3D in order to practice using it because it offers a lot of promise .

#### Goals
The specific end goal is to have a **single parametric design** that can be edited to generate cut files at any scale. The parts **must be repeatable** and be able to adjust designs for materials of varying thicknesses.

#### Re-sawing Plywood
asdfsadf

So I used an app on my phone to work out dimensions and options for re-sawing a 4'x8' sheet of plywood into smaller panels. The app calculates the number of panels I can cut from one sheet of plywood, taking into account the length and width of pieces, the saw blade width, grain direction and other concerns. My laser's bed is only big enough to cut 2 faces at once, so 16"x8" was a good place to start.

**Final Thoughts**

 This project represents many personal milestones for me and I had a blast working on it. I've never had a project that involved as many skills or as much personal growth as this. The product line continues to evolve as it moves to the next stage. I'm currently producing a bespoke website to market them outside of Etsy. I have a debt of gratitude to YC for being the catalyst for all of this.
